## Interview With Sugreev - Data Scientist at Thorn


## Insights From Lisa

*Presentation:*
1. Put Apache Foundation Logo in presentation for open source projects
2. Change in voting style in discussion board:
    1.  	Have checkpoints. Instead of go/no go have checklist like:
            -          Enough D.S
            -          Enough Data etc
    2.  	Have a reputation score and then asssign special powers to D.S to vote for ideas
    3.   	Poll like in slack for checkpoints
3.  	Once graduated to a project, tie it with existing task manager like JIRA

*General Ideas:*
1.  Let DS propose tasks/subtasks instead of NP
2. Capstone projects with students in school. After graduation still available as projects to work on in our website.
3. Reach out to DataKind and other similar organizations to tie with their existing projects
4. Link to existing projects on Github – Open Source License different for Data Science and Maths –
5. Concern around open source vs private repo

## 2. Victoria Dearborn- DS at GrowNYC (Non profit)

no. I just look at numbers of items brought to the swap, taken from the swap, and who came
	
#### 2. What do you think is missing from your stop n swaps? Why hasn't been working?
formalized structure to stop regulars from taking items; having consistent volunteer, having space for event and getting table, Trying to get the word out; Social media just started, but we do advertisement and flyering for marketing	

#### 3. What would you ideally want to solve using data?
I don't really know.  We only record to see who attended, weight of contribution and types of material

#### 4. Do you have resources in order to “work with data” - i.e. money, storage, compute power, contacts, etc.?	
no money, but we do have computer storage	
#### 5. What do you use for storing data/records/etc (paper, excel, databases, etc.)?	
no paper, all computers using excel sheets	

#### 6. How clean is your data/organized. Is it consistent?
Yes it is clean and consistent	
		
#### 7. What outside data or information do you regularly use or think could be useful to your mission (i.e. government records, studies, etc.)	
We really only use our own information. We do use Google docs spreadsheet for community contacts though.

#### 8. Would you be willing to share your data with Domino labs?(not necessarily public, but accessible to them)
I would need to get permission, but I think we would be able to do so.
