## Interview With Sugreev - Data Scientist at Thorn


## Insights From Lisa

Presentation:
1)  	Put Apache Foundation Logo in presentation for open source projects
2)  	Change in voting style in discussion board:
    a)  	Have checkpoints. Instead of go/no go have checklist like:
          -          Enough D.S
          -          Enough Data etc
    b)  	Have a reputation score and then asssign special powers to D.S to vote for ideas
    c)   	Poll like in slack for checkpoints
3)  	Once graduated to a project, tie it with existing task manager like JIRA

General Ideas:
4)    Let DS propose tasks/subtasks instead of NP
5)  	Capstone projects with students in school. After graduation still available as projects to work on in our website.
6)  	Reach out to DataKind and other similar organizations to tie with their existing projects
7)  	Link to existing projects on Github – Open Source License different for Data Science and Maths –
8)  	Concern around open source vs private repo
