## Weekly Logs

*10/22/2017*

## Artifacts

Sprint 2 presentation: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6-UAEl3jFIWWnktVXlDQlVmU1E

## Week Behind

- Scheduled delegate different tasks to teammates. (draw roadmap from now to our Sprint 3, schedule meetings with our potential users)
- Presented at our product studio class. Some of the findings were noted and we are making a note of what we have to do for our next stage
- We are trying to get back to basics and ask, 'Why they would use our products?" as to "How easily and accessible can our product be, so it's adaptable?"

## Week Ahead

- Scheduled meetings with NP and getting more DSs to research on
- Email to one of the more prolific DS (Lutz Finger) and try to validate our idea
- Prepare for the crit
- Prepare for Tech Talk (go over our architecture diagram and find a narrative)

## Risks

- Realized our user demographic is not really represented in our class and it's hard to introduce something they are not familiar with, nor might not care about. So I think we may have to try different approaches to demo or tell the story

## Artifacts
Needed to be Added

## Week Behind

- We held our Crit session and got valuable information on what we need to do to improve our product
- We created a team logo
- We updated our Crit Findings Log (Group B), Description, Core Product Loop, Feature Set of NCP, and Updated Architecture Diagram
- We held off on the adwords as we are going to build our product first, so we have a site to go to for the adwords
- We scheduled 2 meeting with our Group 3 Teacher (general help and sprint 2 overview)

## Week Ahead

- Meet with Peter, co-founder of  DrivenData whose company does similar work as our hmw question, using the power of data science to drive positive social impact. We are looking forward to meeting him.  This is not yet confirmed as he was out of the office and are hoping to get this confirmed before the sprint
- Complete NCP for Second Sprint with focus on discussion board and task product that interacts with the discussion board
- We will start development on the product.

## Risks
- We need to create a demoable version and test it with users
- We do not have a meeting set up with Peter yet

*10/1/2017*

## Week Behind

- We met with our company advisor, Lisa, and gave her the sprint presentation and the demo of our initial 'prototype'. She gave us useful insights which we will incorporate in our prototype.
- We had a meeting with Sugreev, data scientist from non-profit "Thorn". We shared our idea and prototype with him(future user of our product). We got really valuable feedback from him.
- We updated our Architecture Diagram to reflect stubs, ratholes, scaffolding and technologies as per the feedback of our TA
- We made progress by designing the questions for our Adwords campaign to gauge the interest of users(data-scientists and non-profits willingness to sign up on our website)

## Week Ahead

- We have a scheduled meeting with Peter, co-founder of  DrivenData whose company does similar work as our hmw question, using the power of data science to drive positive social impact. We are looking forward to meeting him.
- We will start development on the product.
- We need to prepare for the upcoming Crit

## Risks
- We need to create a demoable version and test it with users

## Week Behind

- After our sprint and getting helpful feedback from classmates and Leeland we are continuing to pursue our initial 'prototype' we have presented in the sprint. 
- We have gotten together to brainstorm and finish our Architecture Diagram. This helped us to give us a better understanding what our first NCP may look like .
- Created our Github and Status board and assigned people to different tasks.
- Development process has been in place and will continue to incorporate it as it has been working out well for the team.
- Two of our teammates were able to attend Data For Good and met with our company champion, Lisa! (aka. the coolest champion) That allowed us to connect with other possible users for our platform.

## Week Ahead

- We are meeting Lisa as a whole team on Monday to present to her what we have presented for Sprint 1 and get her feedback. She has been working in this sector for a while and we believe we can get insightful feedback through this meeting.
- Lisa has connected us with developers for WeAreThorn, and DrivenData and have scheduled to meet Sugreev from WeAreThorn on Thursday.. Paul from DrivenData is currently traveling and we are planning to meet him next week.
- We hope to gather and start to build our actual platform as we get more feedback from potential users (both mentioned above have high potential as users, so we are very excited to talk to them!).
- 

## Risks

- We currently do not have an actual demoable platform and there is always a risk that the users will not be able to get what we are trying to do simply through a presentation (even if it's interactive). 
- We have to think about iteration and create a small demo-able version quickly. Our concept of being 'open source' and 'piece by piece meal' may be a valid solution but this doesn't mean our current solution is the best one and we can't afford to go down a path that we can't get out from.
